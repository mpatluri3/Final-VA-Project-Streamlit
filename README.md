## Introduction
Drug overdose deaths are a major public health concern in the United States, with fatalities rising steadily over the years. This dataset provides insights into overdose deaths from 1999 to 2018, including causes, geographic regions, and annual trends. By analyzing this data, we aim to identify key patterns, high-risk areas, and the primary contributors to overdose fatalities. These insights are essential for supporting policymakers and public health officials in crafting targeted interventions and prevention strategies.

## Data Operation / Abstraction Design
The datasetincludes key details such as causes, states, report dates, and death counts. Data preparation involved cleaning column names, handling missing values, and extracting Year from Report Date. Aggregations were used to analyze trends over time, state-wise comparisons, and common causes of overdose deaths. The analysis is presented through various visualizations designed to make the data more accessible and actionable. line chart for yearly trends, a bar chart for state-wise deaths, a scatter plot for cause-to-death relationships, and a histogram for the distribution of death counts. These analyses simplify the data, highlighting critical patterns for informed public health decisions.

## Future Work
Future efforts can focus on predictive modeling to forecast trends and identify high-risk areas. Integrating socioeconomic and healthcare data can provide deeper insights, while evaluating the impact of policies like opioid restrictions can guide interventions.
